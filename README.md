# hello-world
I'm a Ph.D student in public policy and administration at Mississippi State University. Currently, my focus is on becoming proficient with R. I'm interested in data visualization the most.

As far as policy goes, I primarily work on public health interventions and how they diffuse amongst rural, sparsely populated communities. However, I also have experience working on the diffusion of local option sales taxes, evaluation of programs aimed toward reducing recidivism in juvenile criminal offenders, and analysis of how parental leave programs impact employee satisfaction.
